- Pluto uses the Google coding style. Automatic formatting for this can be done
  through:

  $ clang-format -style=Google

  A .clang-format corresponding to this config exists in its top-level directory.

- Functions, structure members, and non-obvious variables should have comments.

- Contributions should be submitted as pull request on the Github repo:
